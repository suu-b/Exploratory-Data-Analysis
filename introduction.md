EDA is a method used by data scientists to analyze datasets and summarize their main characteristics. It helps determine the best way to manipulate data sources to discover patterns, spot anomalies, testing hypothesis, or to check assumptions. 

## Types of EDA

There are two primary subgroups of EDA - Univariate and Multivariate. 

### Univariate

The data can be described using one variable. Due to single variable, it doesn't include any concept of relationship and causes. Within univariate, there are two further classifications - Graphical (Histograms) and Non-graphical.

### Multivariate

Generally, used for techniques that generally showed relationships between two or more variables of the data through cross tabulation or stats. There are further classifications - Graphical (Heatmaps, bubble maps etc.) and Non-graphical.

## Tools

Python, R
